# Global Food Waste Analysis and Predictions🌍🥪

_Small changes in food waste can lead to massive economic and environmental savings worldwide._

Data Source: 
- [Global Food Wastage dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-food-wastage-dataset-2018-2024) (Kaggle)
- [GDP per Capita dastaset](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD) (World Bank)

This project focuses on answering various questions like:

- 🍗 What food category is wasted the most?
- 📈 What are the global food wastage trends?
- 🌐 What countries waste the most?
- 💵 What are the economic loss trends?
- 🔍 How does income level relate to food waste efficiency?

Besides visualization of the data, a **predictive model** was built to:
- **Predict economic** loss based on food waste
- Simulate a **scenario** where food waste is **reduced by 10%**
- Estimate the **potential economic savings** from reduced waste

To make the analysis more complete, **GDP per Capita** data was merged with the original dataset. 
This helped explore how a country’s **income level** affects how efficiently it manages **food waste**.

### Key Skills Demonstrated
- 📊 Data Cleaning and Merging
- 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis
- 📈 Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- 🧠 Machine Learning Modeling (Random Forest Regressor)
- 💬 Insight Communication and Scenario Analysis

### Final Insights
Reducing **prepared food** waste by just 10% globally between 2018–2024 could have saved approximately **1.75 trillion $** in economic losses, 
proving that smarter waste management could save huge amounts of money and protect the environment.
